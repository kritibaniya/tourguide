  <h2>About Nepal:</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
  Nepal is a small developing country in South Asia. However, the population is
  pretty high for a geographically small country. There are approximately
  28 million residents. These 28 million people follow different religion and
  have different traditions of their traits. Hinduism is major religion but there
  are also plenty of people who follow other religions like Buddhism and Islam.
  Therefore, it will not be wrong to say that Nepal is a very diverse country.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
  Diversity is always fun. It just means more of everything.
  For example different types of cultural dresses, food and languages.
  Nepal has also a very diverse landscape and nature. People often assume that
  Nepal must be a cold place because there are plenty of mountains. However, the
  temperature varies from which part of Nepal you are on. The mountain areas are
  of course cold, but rest of Nepal is very warm. The temperature can reach up to
  40 degrees in some part of the country. However, at the same time it can be
  minus degrees Celsius in other parts.
